<blockquote>
<p>Portions generated by ChatGPT (from bespoke requirements); prompted to act like a software product manager in an agile context.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
<p>To provide a modern, real-time parking space availability system for the City of Moondalup, helping drivers easily find available parking spots in public parking lots and improving overall parking experience and traffic flow.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The city is looking to create a proof-of-concept (POC) to digitize their existing parking resources. The project is a low budget project to add sensors to <strong>uncontrolled</strong> parking lots (ones without a gate) in order to provide drivers and city administrators with live information about parking availability.</p>
<h2 id="user-stories">User Stories</h2>
<h3 id="user-story-1">User Story 1</h3>
<p>As a driver, I want to know the number of available parking spots in a parking lot so that I can quickly find a spot to park my car.</p>
<h3 id="user-story-2">User Story 2</h3>
<p>As a driver, I want to see the current temperature and time while checking for parking availability so that I can plan my activities accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="user-story-3">User Story 3</h3>
<p>As a parking lot manager, I want to track cars entering and leaving the parking lot in real-time so that I can manage parking resources effectively.</p>
<h2 id="technical-backlog-items">Technical Backlog Items</h2>
<ol>
<li>Develop a Python application to count cars entering and exiting the parking lot using SenseHat sensors.</li>
<li>Implement an MQTT broker to publish the parking lot updates, temperature, and time.</li>
<li>Develop a Python application to display parking availability, temperature, and time on a suitable display.</li>
<li>Ensure proper data handling and error prevention (e.g., no negative parking spots).</li>
<li>Update the configuration file format to use TOML with the required attributes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="definition-of-done">Definition of Done</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cars entering and exiting the parking lot are accurately tracked, and a running total of available spots is maintained.</li>
<li>Parking availability updates, temperature, and time are published via MQTT.</li>
<li>Parking availability, temperature, and time are displayed in a user-friendly format on a suitable display.</li>
<li>The system is tested and runs seamlessly on a Raspberry Pi with the SenseHat.</li>
<li>The code is well-documented, object-oriented, and follows best practices.</li>
<li>The configuration file is in TOML format and contains the required attributes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="functional-requirements-summary">Functional Requirements Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li>The system must count cars entering and exiting the parking lot.</li>
<li>The system must maintain a running total of available parking spots.</li>
<li>The system must publish parking availability updates, temperature, and time via MQTT.</li>
<li>The system must display parking availability, temperature, and time on a suitable display.</li>
<li>The system must use a TOML configuration file with the required attributes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="non-functional-requirements-summary">Non-Functional Requirements Summary</h2>
<ol>
<li>The system must be written in Python and run on a Raspberry Pi with the SenseHat.</li>
<li>The system must use an object-oriented programming approach.</li>
<li>The system must display the parking availability updates in real-time.</li>
<li>The system must provide a user-friendly interface for drivers.</li>
<li>The system must handle edge cases, such as full parking lots and more cars than available spots.</li>
<li>The system must be compatible with the City of Moondalup's TOML-based software management practices.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="updated-configuration-file-example-toml-format">Updated Configuration File Example (TOML format)</h2>
<p>```toml</p>
<p>[config]
location = "Moondalup City Square Parking"
total_spaces = 192
broker_host = "localhost"
broker_port = 1883
```</p>
