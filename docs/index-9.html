<li>
<p>Open the <strong>Project</strong> tool window (for example <strong>View | Tool Windows | Project</strong>).</p>

<li>
<p>Select the folder that you want to assign to a certain category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click it and select the desired category from Mark Directory As menu. Specifically:
   a. Mark <code>smartpark/</code> as <strong>Sources Root</strong>
   b. Mark <code>tests/</code> as <strong>Test Sources Root</strong>  </p>

<p>A known weakness of Python is how it manages imports. It is not at all intuitive (but it is not something you have to set up that often). Here's some interesting, if advanced, reading on the subject:

<p>Resolving merge conflicts involves a few steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify the conflicted files</strong>: Git will tell you which files have conflicts that you need to resolve when you attempt a merge operation. If you're not sure which files are in conflict, you can use the following command to get a list:</p>
<p><code>bash
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open the conflicted files and resolve conflicts</strong>: Open each of the conflicted files in a text editor. Git marks the area of conflict with the following format:</p>
<p>```diff
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
(Your changes)
=======
(Changes on the branch that youâ€™re merging)</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>branch-name
```</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to decide whether you want to keep your changes, the changes on the other branch, or a combination of both. Edit the file to resolve the conflicts, removing the conflict markers in the process. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>After editing, stage the resolved files</strong>: After you've resolved all conflicts in a file, you should stage that file using the <code>git add</code> command:</p>
<p><code>bash
git add &lt;resolved-file&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commit the resolved merge</strong>: Once you've resolved all conflicts and staged the resolved files, you can commit the result of the merge:</p>
<p><code>bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Push your changes</strong>: Finally, you can push your changes to the remote repository:</p>
<p><code>bash
git push origin &lt;your-branch&gt;</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, it's important to thoroughly test your code after resolving merge conflicts to ensure that the merging process hasn't caused any unintended side effects.</p>
